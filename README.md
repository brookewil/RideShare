## Section 1 - Pitch:
A software that will allow users to select where they wish to be picked up from and get driven to their specified location. This software must have both a user and a driver's side. The users should be able to send a ride request that includes their name, pick-up location, and future destination. Conversely, the drivers will automatically be assigned a ride request with the amount they will make for the trip. Each user will have ride credits and each ride will cost a different amount depending on the distance. The Driver Manager class should deal with storing the drivers and available trips to be assigned. The manager can create a ride from a driver and request it. The driver should be able to end the trip, and the money should be transferred automatically after the trip has ended.
